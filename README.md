# Unity-Standalone-Portrait-Fix-Anti-Fast-Speed

Tiny code to set Unity **Standalone** builds
1) Open in **Portrait mode** and in correct resolution.
2) Prevent super fast mode (by enabling **VSync**)

**If max resolution is wrong**, use PlayerPrefs.DeleteAll() once.

If any other questions about this code ask to zakirshikhli@gmail.com

# Unity-Standalone-Portrait-Fix-Anti-Fast-Speed

Tiny code for Unity **Standalone** builds to
1) Open in **Portrait mode** and in correct resolution (Window mode).
2) Prevent super fast mode (by enabling **VSync**)



Tips:
1) Enable in Player Settings **Allow Resize**
2) **If max resolution is wrong**, use PlayerPrefs.DeleteAll() once.
